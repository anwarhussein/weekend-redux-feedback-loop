## Description
Weekend-redux-feedback-loop is a react-redux based project where a user is required to give feedback by rating(1-5) to five different questions namely; how he/she is feeling today, understanding of the content,how well supported, and leaving comments afterwards. The responses to these questions are stored in the database(postgresql) and eventually fetched back and stored in redux to display them to the user.
